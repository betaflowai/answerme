What’s an eSIM?

This means that:

You can change providers without needing to order a physical SIM

How do I set up a Dual SIM phone?
Dual SIM phones let you use two SIMs, and therefore have two phone lines. This is ideal if you want to set up your work SIM and personal SIM in the same device, so you don’t have to carry two phones.

Most Dual SIM phones available in 2021 have one physical SIM slot and work with an eSIM (a digital SIM). So, you’ll need one of each to get set up.

Find out more about eSIM

Before you set up Dual SIM, check which type of SIM your phone takes. To do this, go to Device Guides, choose your device, then Specifications. Scroll down to SIM.

Tip: You can have more than one eSIM saved on your phone, but only one can be active at a time.

To set up Dual SIM, you’ll need:

A Dual SIM phone that works with an eSIM
Both a physical SIM and an eSIM. Buy a second SIM if you need one.
An activated SIM card and eSIM (activation instructions come with each).
Now head to our device guides to activate your eSIM and set up Dual SIM

You can change your Dual SIM settings at any time.

I don’t have a SIM card, can I still move to eSIM?
You must have a SIM card so that you can receive texts. This is because you need to log in to My Vodafone to move to eSIM, and we send the security code by text.

If you don’t have a SIM card, chat to us to get a new one. Then you can use it to receive your security code and move over to eSIM.
