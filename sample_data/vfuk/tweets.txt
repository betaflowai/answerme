Hi , my dad has to upgrade his phone as it is only 3G , what is the easiest way for him to get a new smaller SIM
card and move his contacts?
Context :
Bearing in mind he is a total technophobe in his 70's
Answer:
Hi Martin 👋 I hope you're well. To order a new SIM, your Dad can call 40618 from his Vodafone mobile. He’ll need his date of birth and his Vodafone account PIN. Or he can pop into a Vodafone store to pick one up 🙂 Stace

Hey Phil 👋 We don't show average monthly usage, but on the PDF copy of your bills, where you scroll to find the data usage, it tells you the whole amount used for that month at the top of that section 👍Karla
