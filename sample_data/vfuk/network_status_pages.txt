What should I do if I can’t make or receive calls or texts?
First, you should try to:

● Turn your phone off and on again
● Test out different phone numbers – in case you’re trying to call or text an invalid number

If neither of those work, here are some of the most common issues.

Check your payment details or credit amount
If you’re on a Pay monthly plan, check that your payments details are correct and all your payments have been made. If you’ve missed one or more payments, we might have restricted your service

Find out how to pay your bill

If you’re on one of our £10+ Pay as you go bundles or our Pay as you go 1 plan, you’ll have unlimited calls and texts. However, if you’re on one of our older plans, you may have run out of credit or used all your allowances. If so, please either visit our Top up page or our Extras page

Check you’ve got signal
Make sure you don't have airplane or flight mode switched on – check your device settings.

There could be coverage issues due to a network fault in your area. Check for any faults using our network status checker

If there are currently any faults or ongoing maintenance in your area, you might be able to use WiFi Calling

Turn off roaming bars
If you’re abroad, you could have an active roaming bar on your account. If you have access to local WiFi, you can check and remove bars

Unlock your phone
If you bought it from another provider, you might need to get your phone unlocked

Uninstall calling and text apps
If you’ve installed a third-party calling or text app like TrueCaller or Textra SMS, try disabling or uninstalling it.

Can I get mobile network status alerts?
You can set up status alerts to hear about unexpected issues and planned maintenance on our mobile network. We’ll keep you updated on how we're progressing as we address the issue and notify you once the problem's been fixed.

You can manage alerts based on locations you care about or frequently visit, such as your home or work.

There are occasions where we won’t communicate, such as our regular maintenance window during late hours or issues affecting service for a short period of time. Don't worry, we only send updates between the hours of 08:00 and 22:00.

Select My alerts, just below Enter location

Subscribe to alerts will be automatically selected. If not, just tap on it to open the tab
